Developed and evaluated a deep learning, sequence to sequence, model for handwritten character recognition using Pytorch. Leveraged a self-annotated custom dataset of handwritten characters for model training and evaluation.

Achieved over 10% accuracy gain on the test set, demonstrating the effectiveness of the developed model. Performed hyperparameter tuning to optimize the model's performance and generalizability.
